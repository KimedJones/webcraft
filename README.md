# Webcraft Alpha
## What is Webcraft?
Webcraft is a JavaScript port of Minecraft: Java Edition built with Node.JS
## Why is Webcraft being developed?
I'm creating Webcraft because some JS ports of Minecraft are very laggy in chrome and on less powerful systems. Most people playing JS ports of Minecraft like Eaglercraft are on chromebooks or other devices(lbr mostly school computers), so they can't download actual Java Edition and log in to play it. So if Eaglercraft runs very poorly on basic settings on school chromebooks, that means it's running poorly on it's target audience's primary device. Notch's original code that pre 1.17 Java Edition & Eaglercraft is built off of is pure italian spaghetti(not that I even blame him we all have some projects like that + he's using 2008-2012 Java üíÄ), and Eaglercraft was made by just converting that code into JavaScript and filling in the gaps. So, I believe building Minecraft from the ground up in JavaScript would be the best way to have a version of MC running on a chromebook that can actually have a taste of 50+ fps on normal settings.
## When can I expect a playable beta version of Webcraft?
You can expect a Survival test to be finished sometime around late June or early July(keep in mind this is the soonest I could finish it. This IS a side project after all. I have a Unity game + summer HS football practices so it could take up to a month longer)
## When can I expect Webcraft to be finished?
Honestly, I have zero fucking idea üíÄ
I'll post updates every now and then when I make some progress. I'm mainly a C# developer and I only really use JavaScript for web development(which I do on the side), so this is going to be a fun little project to expand my knowledge of JS. If I post an update and you notice I did something stupid or one of my scripts is horrendously messy, feel free to flame me in the comments(when you do, tell me what I can fix).
## Will it be open source?
I guess so. If you know JavaScript and want to mod your game, that's fine with me. I probably can't make this anything but open source without tanking a lawsuit that will put me below the poverty line.
## What features can I expect?
I. Minecraft in your browser(no shit sherlock)
II. Singleplayer + World Saving
III. Local Multiplayer
III. Online Multiplayer(you have to create your own serversl it's much easier with js btw üëç)
IV. My goal is get it to version 1.8 while maintaining good performance on lower spec devices.
V. Mobile compatibility
